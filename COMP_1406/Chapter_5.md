###Paradigm
* a model

####Programming Paradigm
* refers t0 the design used by a programmer to solve a problem]
* a fundemental style or programmer
<br>
ex
* `imparrative, procedual, object oreintated`

###imparrative
* uses statments(commands) to change the programs state
* the state is all the stored data at a given instance of time
* program incrementally changes state over time from an initial state to  an end/goal state

###Procedual Programming
* is a form of imperative programming that useds procedures (rutines, sub-rutines, functions)

###Object orientated programming
* is beases on the concepte of an objects, which has both a state and a behavior
* OOP is trying to simultae the behaviour of a system by modelling the diffrent objects in the system and how they interact with eachother
* an OO program consistes of objects that interat with eachother


####Class bassed OOP
* A class is the blueprint or template tha defines (state) and the proceduares (behaviour) an object can have
* Objects are instatiiantions of the class

####Behaviour of an object
* called methods

####two important thigs of OOP
* Encapsulation : an onjects state and behaviour are both contained in the objecdt itself
* Data Hiding   : the attribute of an object should be hidden from code outside

####Public and Private data
* Public can be accesed from any where
* private can only be acceses throught the class

#####Modifiers
	Access modifiers : resrtic access to object members and methods
	Public: attributes and methods can be accessed by anything that can see the class
	Private : arributes and methods can be accessed only by things inside the class

####Data Hidding
* make your data private so that outside class has no access
* have public get/set methods

####Interface describes what an object can do and the implemntation refers to how it will be done


####C++ a struct is pretty much like a class
* every thing by default is public

####C++ a class
* everything my defualt is private

####C++ functions can be free functions
* functions that are not inside of a class

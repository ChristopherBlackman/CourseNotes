# chapter 1 - introduction : databases and databases users

- traditional applications
	- business data processing ( numeric and textual data bases) 
- more recent applications 
	- multimedia databases
	- GIS
	- bio and Genome databases
	- data warehouses
	- mobile databases
	- real-time active databases
- this course focuses on traditional applications

# basic definitions

Database : a collection of related data stored on a computer
Data : a value that represents know facts with an implicit meaning
mini world : some part of the real world for which the database is developed with its data stored in the data base
database management system:
....


# DBMS 
- load the initial database contents on a secondary storage medium " creates system tables " 
- define a particular database in terms of its data types, structures, and constraints 
- manipulating the database:
	- retrieval : querying, generating reports
	- modification: inter, deletions and updates to its content
	- accessing the database through web applications
- precessing and sharing by a set of concurrent users and application programs - yet , keeping all data valid and consistent

# application interact with a database by generation
- queries: that access different parts of data and formulate the result of a request
- transactions: that may read some data and "update" certain values or generate new data and store that in the database
- application must not allow unauthorized users to access data
- applications must keep up with changing users 
-  protection or security measures to prevent unauthorized access
- presentation and visualization of data
- maintenance of the database and associated application programs over the lifetime of the database application

# examples of a database

- mini-world example
	- part of a university environment
- some mini-world entities :

# characteristics of a database
- self describing nature of a database system
	- a dbnms catalog stores the description of a particular database
	- the description is called meta data
	- this allowed the dbms software to work with different database applications
- insulation between programs and data
	- called program data independence
- data abstraction
	- a data model is used to hide storage details and present the users with a conceptual view of the database
	- programs refer to the data model constructs rather than data storage details 
- support of multiple views of the data :
	- each user may see a different view of the data base
- sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing
	- allowing a set of concurrent users to retrieve from and to update the database
	- concurrent control withing the dmbs grantees that each transaction is correctly executed or aborted
	- recovery subsystem ensures each completed transaction has is it effect permanently recorded in the database
	- Online Transaction Processing 

# database users 
- actors behind the scene
	- those who design and develop the dbms and related tools and the computer system operators
- actors on the scene
	- those who use the system
	
# actors behind the scene
- system designers and implementers
- tool developers
- operators and maintenance personnel

# actors on the scene
- database administrators
	- acquiring software and hardware resources
- database designers
	- defining content
	- communicate with end users and understand their needs 
- system analysts and application developers
	- accounts for a very large portion of the IT work force 
	- system analyst
		- understand the user requirement of end users
	- application programmers
		- implement the specifications 
- end users
	- use that database in day to day basis 
	- don't know how data base is structured 
	
# advantages of using the db approach
- controlling redundancy in data storage and in development and maintenance efforts 
	- sharing of data among multiple users 
- restriction unauthorized access to data. Only the dba staff uses privileged commands and facilities
- providing persistent storage for program object
	- object relational dbms make program objects persistent
- providing storage structures for efficient query processing 
- providing optimization of queries for efficient processing 
- providing backup and recovery services 
- providing multiple interfaces to different classes of users 
- representing complex relationships among data
- enforcing integrity constraints on the database
- drawing inferences and action from the stored data using deductive and active rules and triggers 
- potential for enforcing standards
	- this is very crucial for the success of database applications in large organizations. Standards regard to data item names, display formats, screens...
- reduced application development time
	- incremental time to add each new application is reduced 
- flexibility to change data structures
	- database structure may evolve as new requirements are defined
- availability of current information
- economies of scale 


# when not to use a dbms
- main inhibitors cost of using a dbms
	- high initial investment and possile need ofr additional hardware
	- overhead for providing generality, security, concurrency sonctrol, re
- real time requirements

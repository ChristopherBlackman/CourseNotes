# network model
- introduced by charles bachman
- implemented by honeywell
- later implemented in a large variet of systems	
- the data is organized into a graph lattice structure
	- each parent can have many children
	- each child can have many parents 
	- N:M relationships
- a flexible way of representing entities and their relationshiops
- allows each record to have multiple parednt and chiled recoreds forminga  generalized graph structure
- advantages
	- model complex relationshipos and represts semantics of adddelete on the relationshiops
	- can handle most sisuations for modeling using record types and realationship types
	- langausge is navihational; uses constructs like FIND m FIND memberm FIND, owner. FIND NEXT within set, GET
- disadvantages
	- navaigational and procedural nature of processing
	- data base contrains a comlex arraly of pointers that thread though a set of records 
- failed to become dominiat due to
	- IBM chose to stich to hieracical model with semi-network extenion
	- relational model

# hierarchical model
- join errort by IMB and North Americal Rockwell
- resuted in IMS
- the data is organized into a tree like structure using records and links on disk reather than in memory
	- data is stored as recoreds which are collection of field with each field containing only one value, 
	- records are connected to another though links
	- each record having one paredt an many children so that recordds relationshiops form a tree0like modle
	- all attribues of a specific refort ar listed under an enitiy tyoe
- one to many relation
- advatages
	- simple to construct and iperate
	- corresponst to a number of natural hierachically organized domains
	- language is simple
		- "GET , GET UNIQUE, GET NEXT, GET NEXT WITHIN PARENT"
- disadvantafes

# relational model
- all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations


# relactional vs network
- relational is an ideal model but not preformace  won;t be acceptable
- it thretents the network stanardization

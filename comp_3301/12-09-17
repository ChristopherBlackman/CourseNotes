# genre

- a specific type of writing (painting, music ...)
- pieces within a genre share commonalities
	- style, subject matter
- literary genres : romance, western, mystery....
- broad , possibly overlapping categories 


``` 
Here's what bothers me. 
It's one thing if you have preliminary data suggesting your approach won't work.
That is, your planned experiment cannot result in interpretable data. 
That , I would agree, is a serious problem.

- possibly a blog post

# genres 

- code of conduct for a particular discourse
	- common practice
	- reflects/embodies expectations of audience
	- implies objectives for the writer ( and reader)
- some genres 
	- technical writing
	- journalism
	- blogging
	- IM
	- twitter


# technical writing

- a genre with its own structure and properties
- characteristics
	- uses direct, transparent writing
	- as simple as possible ( but not simpler)
	- fairly formal ( avoid contractions, say)
	- strives to be precise and unambiguous
	- talks about factual matters, lays out reasoning

# virtues of technical writing

- clarity
	- be as clear and unambiguous as possible
- economy
	- omit unnecessary words
	- get your point across efficiently
- simplicity
	- write directly and to the point
	- explain as simple a possible ( but no more simply)

# clarity

- be specific
- be concrete
	- examples help
- be direct
	- just come out and say what you mean
	- avoid waffle and hedging

```
A computer is basically a big adding machine.
```

- 'basically' is hedging
- if removed basically, then an unnecessary abstraction
- not providing an accurate detail

```
A computer is essentially a big adding machine.
```

- more formal but still has not explained 

```
A computer is essentially a big adding machine.
```
- that is not what we are saying at all
- clear that the analogy has not been explained 


```
Potatoheads's algorithm is "good" ```
```
- to ambiguous 

``` 
A prediction algorithm is considered "good" if the actual outcome is within 10% of the estimate at least 70% of the time. By this standard Potatohead's algorithm is "good"/
```

- this saves the previous statement
- now gives us a definition 

```
PH's algorithm works by identifying the data that is "closest to" the source and hence most reliable. 
```
- give the measurement not the vague intuition

```
tests were conducted using popular modern operating systems.
```
- be more specific and time sensitive 
- "passive voice" : just say that something happened, not whom did it " who did the tests in this sentence "

```
We tested our application on windows 8, windows 10 and macosx...
```
- fix

```
we tested out application on windows.....
````
- fix fix

it may be possible to further improve the speed in the future.
```
- weak statement ( always true)
- lack of information 
	- first person could be used to add more information

network disruptions can affect only certain groups of nodes

v1
network disruptions an have uneven impact; for example, a disruption might affect some groups of nodes while others remain unaffected.
```
- multiple interpretations

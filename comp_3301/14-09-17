# vagueness
- very hard to extract specific meaning from the highly general language used

# wordiness
- omit unnecessary words
- strive to write briefly
- blaise pascal : " I have made the [letter] longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter"

## vices 
- roundabout phrasings
- abstract nouns
- weak verbs
- extraneous adjectives

- question whether the sentence belongs there at all : is its content important?


# nominalization
- making a noun from a verb
	- e.g. investigate -> investigation
	- e.g. applicable -> applicability
- sometimes produces verbose writing
	- writer combines a noun and a weak verb

```

the method must verify the input ... vs ... the method must perform the verification of the input 
```

```
memory usage has increased vs there has been an increase in memory usage
```


```

```
- much shorter

# On Summaries
- identify the authors main points
- identify the key concepts and explain them
	- provide some context and background
	- don't overdo it : your budget is limited
- provide transition between concepts
- avoid editorilizaion

# paragraphs
- develop and explore a single coherent idea
- corollary : when you change the subject, begin a new paragraph
- ask your self: what is the central idea in this paragraph


# paragraphs and summaries
- suggestion : make one bullet for each paragraph in the article
- afterwards, analyze : old together multiple closely related bullets
	- reverse engineer structure of article
- this mechanical process ensures you don't overlook anything 

# your paragraphs
- when writing a paragraph : ask yourself what is the main idea of this paragrap
- don't stray away from it
	- save material for another paragraph
- develop the idea
	- don't write single sentence paragraphs
- a good length is generally 3-5 sentences 

# the sentence
- also contains a single idea
- less complex and developed than a paragraphs idea
- don't fear splitting sentences in two, three
	- but can save words by merging sentences if they discuss the same idea










what kind of writing is this

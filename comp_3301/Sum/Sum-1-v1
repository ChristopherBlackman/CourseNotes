When in control of a vehicle, there are many moral decisions associated with how one operates the machine.

Based on these day-to-day moral decisions, computers have sensors that react based on pre-programmed logic.

Yet, theses preprogrammed logic machines have far greater reaction times, perception abilities and do not suffer from symptoms of human fatigue or conditions.

Roughly ninety percent of car crashes are cause by human error and by introducing driverless cars to solve this problem without generating more entropy; this would be the scenario of least consequences.

However, should and unavoidable incident occur, vision technology is not yet at the stage where it can identify objects and react based on morals.

Detection technology used in modern cars only see numerical values based on brightness of pixels; it must then infer what theses pixels are, which is easy for the average human.

In time detection technology will be able to recognize more complex objects, but as of the moment only simple objects are recognizable with a high degree of accuracy.

Once detection technology becomes adequate; blaming inadequacy of technology is no longer viable excuse to restrict driverless cars, thus more responsible ethical decisions must be contrived.

This is a difficult answer as drivers are often faced with less than ideal options in unavoidable situations.

An example of a kind of situation is the 'trolley problem' seen as a common problem in Ethics.

# technical communication
- intedned to communicate information to the target audience
	- commnets in code
	- co-op work term report
	- scientific paper
- relies on direct, unambigous languae; clear progression of ideas; transparent style 

# the challend of writing
- you know what you mean but the reader does not
	- " empty mind " the disiple of reading only what is on the page and ignoring your prior knowlege 
- be direct
- avoid ambiguity
	- avoid opportnitites for alternative parsings
- seek simplicity

# common mistakes

```
The compiler did not accept the program because it contained errors.
```
- ambiguity
- put the important information a the begining of the sentence

```
Participants read assertions whose veracirt was either affiremd or denid by the subsequent presentation of an assessment word 
```
- to much butter for a smiple true or false with a supportive fact

# In Class Writing text

```
The Umbrella: it is a mobile water resistance device used to protect one self from water. 
In many cases it is used to take shelter from the rain. It has a long steel pole as the shaft.
This shaft is used as the handle for the device; tipically on the bottom. 
Connected to the uppermost part of the shaft is a water resistant membrain used to reple water.

# paper / artical summaries
- a default wrting assignment : summarize a selected articl
	- in your own words  - avoid quoting , close paraphrasing
- capture the essential ideas of the article in a much smaller space 

# summary pitfalls
- quoting and paraphrasing
- avoid - use your own words
- close parapahre ( subsituting words here and there) counts as copying and is unhelpful with the summary anywaly rewrite entirely in a condesed format
- missing main points
- elements crusial to the dvelpopment of the argument must be retained
- sumary need not shadow the original - emphasis can differ
- including unnecessar material
	- fluff
	- bread expolanatory matter
- lose writing within the summary
- can arise from a mechanical process of condensing material without regard for importance
- oversummarising - what you write does not stand on its own
- use technical terms without explanation
- omitting connections amoung different parts ofth discussion; do make sure that the summary flows nicely and the reasonining is reserved 
- metadiscourse ( not about the content but the writing it self) 
- writing about writing
	- as opposed to the content of the writing

# on quoting
- there are only a few reason to quote
	- the original is striking
	- you want to analyze  the specific wording used
	- you want to cleary attribute the ideas to the author and distance yourself
- these dont apple to your summaries - use your own words
